# What are some differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript?

Before explaining the differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript, we need to know what TypeScript is, what an interface is, and what a type is. Now we know about this.

---
**TypeScript :** TypeScript is a strongly typed, object-oriented, compiled language developed by Microsoft. It's a superset of JavaScript, meaning it includes all of JavaScript's functionality and adds additional features, most notably static typing. TypeScript code is transpiled into JavaScript, which can then be executed in any JavaScript runtime environment.

**Interfaces :** Interfaces in TypeScript serve as contracts that define the structure of objects. They specify the properties and methods an object must have, without providing an implementation. Interfaces are primarily used for type checking, ensuring that objects conform to a specific shape.

**Types :** Types in TypeScript serve as a way to define the shape and structure of data, enabling static type checking during development. They act as labels that describe the properties and methods that a value possesses. TypeScript's type system helps catch errors early, improve code readability, and enhance maintainability.

### Here is the difference between interfaces and types in TypeScript:

1. Syntax Differences

**Interface:**
Uses the interface keyword to define object structures.

```
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}
```

**Type:**
Uses the type keyword for definitions.
```
type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};
```

2. Declaration Merging

**Interfaces** support declaration merging, allowing multiple definitions of the same interface to combine.

```
interface User {
  name: string;
}

interface User {
  age: number;
}

const user: User = { name: "Alice", age: 30 }; // Works fine
```


**Types** do not support declaration merging. If you need to combine types, you can use intersections:

```
type User = {
  name: string;
} & {
  age: number;
};

const user: User = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
```

3. Extensibility

**Interfaces** can be extended using the extends keyword:

```
interface Employee extends User {
  position: string;
}

const employee: Employee = { name: "Alice", age: 30, position: "Developer" };
```

**Types** achieve similar functionality using intersections:
```
type Employee = User & { position: string };

const employee: Employee = { name: "Alice", age: 30, position: "Developer" };
```


4. Usage in Class Implementation4. Usage in Class Implementation

**Interfaces** are often used as contracts for classes:

```
interface Greet {
  greet(): string;
}

class Person implements Greet {
  greet() {
    return "Hello!";
  }
}
```

**Types** cannot directly be implemented by a class.


### Conclusion
Interfaces and types both play necessary roles in TypeScript, each best applied to specific cases. Apply interfaces to define object shapes or class contracts, and types to more complex cases involving unions, intersections, or aliasing. Understanding how they are different will help you write cleaner, more maintainable, and type-safe code.
